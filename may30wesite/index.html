Last night I dreamed that we had a date planned. We were together and decided that we would separate and reconvene in an hour to go on this park date. I ended up missing the date by several hours because I was hanging out with other people and I think I smoked weed, and I didn’t check my phone. Long story short, at some point later in the day, I checked my phone and there were some angry messages from you.

So then I woke up, feeling badly, and I began to think about our conversation last night. Particularly, how I felt when you brought up the fact that the person you were hooking up with was not a stranger.

(As a quick aside, I don’t think it was really jealousy that had me all twisted up. I think it was closer to a feeling of injustice; that you had been so quick to hook up with someone else… A feeling of betrayal I suppose, and the feeling that you had really wanted to be with someone else when we were together. Maybe an affirmation that I really was a bad partner.)

Then, yes, there was a bit of relief when things were stated plainly, and I no longer had to imagine a flurry of hypothetical lovers…  But, I think there were many such conversations that were blunted by my getting overwhelmed with some emotion which comes with what feels like a physical shutdown. And in those moments, I really feel like the problem. Like you’re just waiting for me to figure it out. That you have it figured out. It’s really distressing to feel like I am the one holding back progress, and that I am perpetually the emotionally stunted and unintelligible. You seem so much more confident in those moments, much more willing to give some diagnosis as to what is ailing me, and it makes me feel like a child. And that’s funny because I really cherish my child-like qualities… But then we come back to respect. Because maybe that’s where the ego screams, quieting the body and mind. By which I mean, eventually, in these conversations, there seems to come a moment where I am threatened by your judgement of me, where I am acquiescing to your analysis because I believe it to be true in some way, and because I often can’t find an adequate retort in that moment. 

In some ways, it really is your arena. 

Another moment. We are walking back towards the car from barflys, and I make an analogy about a PT working a knot out of someone’s calf; that’s what the conversation felt like. You say that all conversations with me feel like that. Really? In that analogy, I am the knot? If it’s so onerous, why bother? It just makes me feel like I am the problem, that it’s mostly me. I don’t feel like all our conversations are removing a big fat knot from a big fat calf. I still believe in the ethos that we get things out of each other that we didn’t know we had. 

Maybe the problem is I’m still doing too much talking.
